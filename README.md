# Google Maps Add-on for Vaadin 7

Enables Google Maps in Vaadin 7 projects via JavaScript API 3!

Get it from [Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory#!addon/googlemaps-add-on).

Check out the demo @ [http://tapio.app.fi/googlemaps/](http://tapio.app.fi/googlemaps/). 

## Development notice ##

If you don't use dependency management (i.e. Maven or Ivy) you'll have to manually add `GWT-Maps-V3-Api` and `GWT-AjaxLoader` jars to your project. Without them you'll get errors like

	[ERROR] Unable to find 'com/google/gwt/maps/Maps.gwt.xml' on your classpath;` 
while trying to compile the widgetset.

## Usage notice ##

In order to use Google Maps API, you'll need to get an API key from [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). The key is not normally needed when developing in localhost.
